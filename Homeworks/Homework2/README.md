# CS 315 Homework Assignment 2

**Assigned: Nov. 25, 2022  
Due: Dec. 3, 2022, 23:59**

## User-Located Loop Control Mechanisms in Dart, Javascript, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Rust

---

In this homework assignment, you will investigate how some design issues, related to the user-located loop control mechanisms, are addressed in Dart, Javascript, Lua, PHP, Python, Ruby, and Rust languages. The design issues you will investigate are

*   Should the conditional mechanism be an integral part of the exit (conditional or unconditional exit)?
*   Should only one loop body be exited or can enclosing loops also be exited (labeled or unlabeled exit)?

First, investigate how each of these questions is answered in each of these programming languages. Then write simple programs _clearly_ illustrating the design decisions for the issues in the languages. Discuss the results of the execution of your programs in a report.

For each design issue and each language, your example codes should explain the answer using code segments in the respective language. You can illustrate the answers to these questions, in different parts of a single program. The example programs must be complete.

You can use online compilers/interpreters for this homework.

For each language, prepare a single source code file that exemplifies and tests each design issue, in the order given above. Your example programs must be different than the sample codes that may be available on the Internet. To help the TA understand your code and give you good grades, appropriately comment on your source code to explain your example and why your example is appropriate for this homework.

Organize all of your experiments and their results and put them into a report. The report should include the following:

### Submission:

A single **`zip`** or **`rar`** file should be submitted containing the following files with given names:

#### Part A - Report (65 Points)

A single file for **report**: lastname\_name\_report.pdf

1.  For each language and for each design issue, sample code segments and the results of their execution. You should explain what your example does, clearly. Make sure you give a list of references and proper citations to these references in your report about the design choices for these issues in the languages covered in this homework. (45 points)
2.  A section that includes your evaluation of these languages in terms of readability and writability of User-Located Loop Control Mechanisms. Write a paragraph discussing, in your opinion, which language is the best in terms of the User-Located Loop Control Mechanisms. Explain why. (10 points)
3.  A section about your learning strategy. A learning strategy is an individual's approach to completing a task. In this section, discuss, in detail, the material and tools you used, and the experiments you performed. Also talk about personal communication, if you had. Give the URLs of the online compilers/interpreters you used to run your programs (10 points)

#### Part B - Source Code Folder (35 Points)

A folder called, **Codes**. The contents of the folder will be as follows:

1.  A single file for **Dart** code: lastname\_name.dart (5 points)
2.  A single file for **Javascript** code: lastname\_name.html (5 points)
3.  A single file for **Lua** code: lastname\_name.lua (5 points)
4.  A single file for **PHP** code:lastname\_name.php (5 points)
5.  A single file for **Python** code: lastname\_name.py (5 points)
6.  A single file for **Ruby** code: lastname\_name.rb (5 points)
7.  A single file for **Rust** code: lastname\_name.rs (5 points)

Please upload the **`zip`** or **`rar`** file you created to Moodle before the due date.

### Important Notes:

*   The maximum page limit for the report is 20.

*   Late submissions will be accepted, with 10 points (out of 100) deduction for each extra day.

*   You may use the tutorials available on the Internet as a reference, but do not derive your example from the contents of the tutorials. If you do so, your programs may be similar to others in the class, which causes a disciplinary investigation.

*   Collaboration on homework assignments is not allowed.
